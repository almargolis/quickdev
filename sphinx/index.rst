   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to EzDev's documentation!
========================================

EzDev is an application framework supporting Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principles
and advanced data modeling. It includes support for development and operations.

Developing an application requires a significant amount of environmental
configuration. None of that is very hard, but can be a minor nuisance.
EzDev attempts to provide frictionless project start-up so you can
immediately start coding and testing application code.
The environment configuration has defaults which "just work".
A personal configuration file to specify your preferences so
it works the way you like.
