QuickDev Development Style
========

There are an infinite number of ways to develop systems. The only thing you have to do is
open up an editor and start typing away. With each line of non-trivial code comes a
cascade of options from which you have to select based on your environments and preferences.
It's easy to get stalled by the plethora of options.

QuickDev attempts to make this easier by providing a roadmap and a host of idioms prepackaged
as code. QuickDev has a strong point of view. While I have a sub-goal of providing modules
and tools that are general purpose, the system will be most useful to people who adopt
the QuickDev style.
