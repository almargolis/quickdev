CommerceNode Directories
========================

CnCore: A collection of fundamental services that could be useful for a broad range of applications. These services mainly implement operating and network operations as idioms with consistent data sources.

CnFramework: An application framework that can be used to build a variety of online and command line applications. CnFramework integrates a rich data modeling language and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.

CnHosting: A set of utilities to assist in hosting of CommerceNode applications. CnHosting supports multi-tenant hosts and multi-server applications

Site: A directory which is the root of execution for an application on a particular server. This will often be an Apache document root directory but that is not necessarily the case. The Site directory will generally have a long life (the lifetime of that application on that server) but it is considered a transient directory. It contains mainly symlinks to source data and generated data and code. Recreating a site directory is fast and easy. It does not need to be backed up.
