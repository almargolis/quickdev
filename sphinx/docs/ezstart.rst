EzStart
========

EzStart is a command line utility used to create, repair or configure a QuickDev site.

If a directory is specified, EzStart will use that as the site directory.
It will create the directory if it doesn't exist.
Otherwise it will use the current directory.

EzStart's goal is to exit with a functioning site. To the degree possible, it
performs all required QuickDev and system administration functions needed to
configure the site.

Every site has an acronym which is used to identify the site. The acronym must begin
with a letter and contains letters, numbers and underscores. It should be reasonably
short.
